## react-redux-ssr setup development kit

this is a minimum bare setup for development of **react-redux-ssr** apps ready to be published/deployed on **nodejs** hosting services.

you do **npm i --production** if you don't want to develop. but because this is not the case, you do **npm i** instead.

you do **npm run dev** to develop.

you do **npm run build** and **npm run start** when you want to run the app.

this app has been deployed to **heroku** and can be accessed through https://react-redux-ssr.herokuapp.com.
